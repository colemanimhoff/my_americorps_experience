  <h2>What is AmeriCorps?</h2>
  <p>Are you interested traveling, working on community projects, and earning money for school? AmeriCorps may be a good option for you. While AmeriCorps offers a variety of programs to choose from, I am here to tell you my experience with <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps/americorps-nccc"> The National
    Civilian and Community Corps </a> (also know as “N Triple-C”).</p>

  <p>NCCC is s a full-time, team-based residential national service program for those who want to give back to communities in need at different locations across the country. NCCC members can serve as a Corps Member or Team Leader. I’ve completeds one year
    of each, and both were amazing experiences.</p>

  <p>In October of 2008, I was placed in Denver, CO. During my year as a Corps Member, I completed four projects. I lived in Cameron and Lake Charles, Louisiana to participate in a variety of post Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, I performed controlled
    burns with the Department of Wildlife in central Missouri, and performed energy audits for low-income families back in Denver. I also led several volunteer projects with at-risk youth.</p>

  <p>I loved my Corps Member experience so much, I decided to become a Team Leader the following year. My tenure began as assistant to our Campus’ Operations Manager. Shortly after, I was deployed to American Samoa to work with The Red Cross in natural disaster
    relief efforts for the tsunami of 2009. Next, it was time to acquire a team of Corps Members. We became wild land firefighters in Fort Collins, built houses in New Orleans, and constructed trails and bridges in a State Park in the middle-of-nowhere,
    Texas.

  <p>This was obviously a busy couple of years, but I wouldn’t have traded for anything. I made over $10,000 to pay back student loans, traveled, learned a lot about myself, and made unforgettable friends and memories. </p>
  <p>...And I got paid to do it.</p>
